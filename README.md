# CS-255
A repo for CS 255 projects
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
For the DriverPass project, we were presented with a transcript for an interview with a small business owner, who saw a need for better driver training
in his city, to help people pass their license exams. The system they requested was honestly very complex, and that was part of the challenge. Deciding 
which features made sense, and which features were nice to haves was very interesting.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel my technical explanations were quite good. I gave very specific technologies and strategies for creating the DriverPass system, and they all made
sense and would have been an excellent piece of software had we actually designed the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I wish I'd spent more time analyzing the requirments, and picking features. I could have also come up with other, minor features, that the owner maybe didn't
think of directly, but would have been necesary to support the application. I wish I had taken the time to think through the whole problem more carefully.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
For this system, it's important to remember that before anything else users need to be able to sign on and get billed. That's the income stream of the business, and
without it, there's nothing. I prioritized that being as seamless as possible in my designs. I also recomened a cloud based infrastructure, as that will scale with the small business well.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I start by finding requirments, then I decide the minimum viable product. After I have that I sort the remaining requirements in order of necesity to the delivery.
For the actual system design, I use different methods depending on the technology. For java or C++ I'm using pretty standard object oriented design, lot's of classes, each with their own specific use. If I'm coding in javascript, that becomes less a priority, as I might implement more functional programming systems instead. It really depends a lot on the project and the technology, and varies wildly. There's no such thing as one tool for every problem. Though I suppose if that did exist it would be python.
